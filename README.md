## fork of Chris81T/lift-json-rest-angular but with sbt instead of maven

How to:
- 1. clone the project
- 2. go to the folder and execute ./sbt
- 3. sbt will download all necessary dependencies and when it's done you'll see a prompt > waiting for commands
- 4. type container:start this will compile all source codes and start the embedded jetty server
- 5. Go to localhost:8080 to see the app running. Enjoy
